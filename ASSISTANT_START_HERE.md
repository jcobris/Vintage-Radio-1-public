# Assistant Start Here

Read these first:
- docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/PINOUT.md
- docs/README.md
- PROJECT_STATE.md

Working style:
- One step at a time.
- Keep Arduino Nano as target unless resources force ESP32.

Goal for this session:
- Merge existing working test sketches into a modular final sketch that compiles and runs.
